// Analysis:
// Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while loop nested within the for loop, closer inspection reveals it to be linear.
// Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks the beginning of a sequence (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in nums), the while loop can only run for nn iterations throughout the entire runtime of the algorithm.
// This means that despite looking like O(nâ‹…n) complexity, the nested loops actually run in O(n + n) = O(n) time. All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall runtime is linear.
// think:
// 		if all the numbers are discrete, iteration is n
// 		if all belong to one sequence, iteration is still n
