[2948. Make Lexicographically Smallest Array by Swapping Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-lexicographically-smallest-array-by-swapping-elements/)

`Medium`

You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums and a positive integer limit.

In one operation, you can choose any two indices i and j and swap nums[i] and nums[j] if |nums[i] - nums[j]| <= limit.

Return the lexicographically smallest array that can be obtained by performing the operation any number of times.

An array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b if in the first position where a and b differ, array a has an element that is less than the corresponding element in b. For example, the array [2,10,3] is lexicographically smaller than the array [10,2,3] because they differ at index 0 and 2 < 10.
 
```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,5,3,9,8], limit = 2
Output: [1,3,5,8,9]
Explanation: Apply the operation 2 times:
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,3,5,9,8]
- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. The array becomes [1,3,5,8,9]
We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.
Note that it may be possible to get the same result by doing different operations.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,7,6,18,2,1], limit = 3
Output: [1,6,7,18,1,2]
Explanation: Apply the operation 3 times:
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,2,1]
- Swap nums[0] with nums[4]. The array becomes [2,6,7,18,1,1]
- Swap nums[0] with nums[5]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,1,2]
We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,7,28,19,10], limit = 3
Output: [1,7,28,19,10]
Explanation: [1,7,28,19,10] is the lexicographically smallest array we can obtain because we cannot apply the operation on any two indices.
```

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Construct a virtual graph where all elements in nums are nodes and the pairs satisfying the condition have an edge between them.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Instead of constructing all edges, we only care about the connected components.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Can we use DSU?

<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>

Sort nums. Now we just need to consider if the consecutive elements have an edge to check if they belong to the same connected component. Hence, all connected components become a list of position-consecutive elements after sorting.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>

For each index of nums from 0 to nums.length - 1 we can change it to the current minimum value we have in its connected component and remove that value from the connected component.
