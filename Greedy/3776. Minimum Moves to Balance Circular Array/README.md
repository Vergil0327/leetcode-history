[3776. Minimum Moves to Balance Circular Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-balance-circular-array/)

`Medium`

You are given a circular array balance of length n, where balance[i] is the net balance of person i.

In one move, a person can transfer exactly 1 unit of balance to either their left or right neighbor.

Return the minimum number of moves required so that every person has a non-negative balance. If it is impossible, return -1.

Note: You are guaranteed that at most 1 index has a negative balance initially.

```
Example 1:
Input: balance = [5,1,-4]
Output: 4
Explanation:

One optimal sequence of moves is:

Move 1 unit from i = 1 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [5, 0, -3]
Move 1 unit from i = 0 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [4, 0, -2]
Move 1 unit from i = 0 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [3, 0, -1]
Move 1 unit from i = 0 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [2, 0, 0]
Thus, the minimum number of moves required is 4.

Example 2:
Input: balance = [1,2,-5,2]
Output: 6
Explanation:

One optimal sequence of moves is:

Move 1 unit from i = 1 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [1, 1, -4, 2]
Move 1 unit from i = 1 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [1, 0, -3, 2]
Move 1 unit from i = 3 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [1, 0, -2, 1]
Move 1 unit from i = 3 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [1, 0, -1, 0]
Move 1 unit from i = 0 to i = 1, resulting in balance = [0, 1, -1, 0]
Move 1 unit from i = 1 to i = 2, resulting in balance = [0, 0, 0, 0]
Thus, the minimum number of moves required is 6.​​​

Example 3:
Input: balance = [-3,2]
Output: -1
Explanation:

​​​​​​​It is impossible to make all balances non-negative for balance = [-3, 2], so the answer is -1.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n == balance.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= balance[i] <= 10^9
- There is at most one negative value in balance initially.

If there is no negative value, then the answer is 0. If the total sum is less than 0, then the answer is -1.

Sort the positive values in nums by their distance from the index with the negative value.

Greedily use as many values as needed from the sorted nums to offset the current negative value.
