[2499. Minimum Total Cost to Make Arrays Unequal](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-total-cost-to-make-arrays-unequal/description/)

`Hard`

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, of equal length n.

In one operation, you can swap the values of any two indices of nums1. The cost of this operation is the sum of the indices.

Find the minimum total cost of performing the given operation any number of times such that nums1[i] != nums2[i] for all 0 <= i <= n - 1 after performing all the operations.

Return the minimum total cost such that nums1 and nums2 satisfy the above condition. In case it is not possible, return -1.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5], nums2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
One of the ways we can perform the operations is:
- Swap values at indices 0 and 3, incurring cost = 0 + 3 = 3. Now, nums1 = [4,2,3,1,5]
- Swap values at indices 1 and 2, incurring cost = 1 + 2 = 3. Now, nums1 = [4,3,2,1,5].
- Swap values at indices 0 and 4, incurring cost = 0 + 4 = 4. Now, nums1 =[5,3,2,1,4].
We can see that for each index i, nums1[i] != nums2[i]. The cost required here is 10.
Note that there are other ways to swap values, but it can be proven that it is not possible to obtain a cost less than 10.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [2,2,2,1,3], nums2 = [1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
One of the ways we can perform the operations is:
- Swap values at indices 2 and 3, incurring cost = 2 + 3 = 5. Now, nums1 = [2,2,1,2,3].
- Swap values at indices 1 and 4, incurring cost = 1 + 4 = 5. Now, nums1 = [2,3,1,2,2].
The total cost needed here is 10, which is the minimum possible.

Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2], nums2 = [1,2,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
It can be shown that it is not possible to satisfy the given conditions irrespective of the number of operations we perform.
Hence, we return -1.
```

Constraints:

- n == nums1.length == nums2.length
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= n

<summary>Hint 1</summary>

How can we check which indices of nums1 will be considered for swapping? How to minimize the number of such operations?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

It can be seen that greedily swapping values of indices where nums1[i] == nums2[i] is the most optimal choice. How many values cannot be swapped this way?

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Find which indices we will swap these remaining values with, and if there are enough such indices.
