[3474. Lexicographically Smallest Generated String](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-smallest-generated-string/)

`Hard`

You are given two strings, str1 and str2, of lengths n and m, respectively.

A string word of length n + m - 1 is defined to be generated by str1 and str2 if it satisfies the following conditions for each index 0 <= i <= n - 1:

If str1[i] == 'T', the substring of word with size m starting at index i is equal to str2, i.e., word[i..(i + m - 1)] == str2.
If str1[i] == 'F', the substring of word with size m starting at index i is not equal to str2, i.e., word[i..(i + m - 1)] != str2.
Return the lexicographically smallest possible string that can be generated by str1 and str2. If no string can be generated, return an empty string "".

```
Example 1:
Input: str1 = "TFTF", str2 = "ab"
Output: "ababa"
Explanation:

The table below represents the string "ababa"
Index	T/F	Substring of length m
0	'T'	"ab"
1	'F'	"ba"
2	'T'	"ab"
3	'F'	"ba"
The strings "ababa" and "ababb" can be generated by str1 and str2.

Return "ababa" since it is the lexicographically smaller string.

Example 2:
Input: str1 = "TFTF", str2 = "abc"
Output: ""
Explanation:

No string that satisfies the conditions can be generated.

Example 3:
Input: str1 = "F", str2 = "d"
Output: "a"
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n == str1.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= m == str2.length <= 500
- str1 consists only of 'T' or 'F'.
- str2 consists only of lowercase English characters.
