Intuition:

1. first I think I can take one and skip one approach to try all the possibilities. (top-down DP)

2. then, I found that every time I want to find next candidate job, I always do linear search to find next. therefore, I replace linear search with `sorting & binary search`

3. cache previous work and early return the result (memorization)
