[3569. Maximize Count of Distinct Primes After Split](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-count-of-distinct-primes-after-split/)

`Hard`

You are given an integer array nums having length n and a 2D integer array queries where queries[i] = [idx, val].

For each query:

Update nums[idx] = val.
Choose an integer k with 1 <= k < n to split the array into the non-empty prefix nums[0..k-1] and suffix nums[k..n-1] such that the sum of the counts of distinct prime values in each part is maximum.
Note: The changes made to the array in one query persist into the next query.

Return an array containing the result for each query, in the order they are given.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,3,1,2], queries = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:

Initially nums = [2, 1, 3, 1, 2].
After 1st query, nums = [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]. Split nums into [2] and [2, 3, 1, 2]. [2] consists of 1 distinct prime and [2, 3, 1, 2] consists of 2 distinct primes. Hence, the answer for this query is 1 + 2 = 3.
After 2nd query, nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 2]. Split nums into [2, 2, 3] and [3, 2] with an answer of 2 + 2 = 4.
The output is [3, 4].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,1,4], queries = [[0,1]]
Output: [0]
Explanation:

Initially nums = [2, 1, 4].
After 1st query, nums = [1, 1, 4]. There are no prime numbers in nums, hence the answer for this query is 0.
The output is [0].
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= n == nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
- 1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
- 0 <= queries[i][0] < nums.length
- 1 <= queries[i][1] <= 10^5

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Preprocess all primes up to max(nums) with a sieve to enable O(1) primality checks.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

For each prime p, record its occurrence indices; if it appears at least twice, treat [first, last] as a segment, and note that the split position k with the most overlapping segments equals the number of primes counted on both sides.

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Use a segment tree with lazy propagation over all possible k to maintain, update, and query the sum of distinct-prime counts in the prefix and suffix, adjusting for overlaps.
