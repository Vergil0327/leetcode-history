[3762. Minimum Operations to Equalize Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-equalize-subarrays/)

`Hard`

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

In one operation, you can increase or decrease any element of nums by exactly k.

You are also given a 2D integer array queries, where each queries[i] = [li, ri].

For each query, find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the subarray nums[li..ri] equal. If it is impossible, the answer for that query is -1.

Return an array ans, where ans[i] is the answer for the ith query.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,4,7], k = 3, queries = [[0,1],[0,2]]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation:
One optimal set of operations:

i	[li, ri]	nums[li..ri]	Possibility	Operations	Final
nums[li..ri]	ans[i]
0	[0, 1]	[1, 4]	Yes	nums[0] + k = 1 + 3 = 4 = nums[1]	[4, 4]	1
1	[0, 2]	[1, 4, 7]	Yes	nums[0] + k = 1 + 3 = 4 = nums[1]

			nums[2] - k = 7 - 3 = 4 = nums[1]	[4, 4, 4]	2
Thus, ans = [1, 2].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 2, queries = [[0,2],[0,0],[1,2]]
Output: [-1,0,1]
Explanation:

One optimal set of operations:

i	[li, ri]	nums[li..ri]	Possibility	Operations	Final
nums[li..ri]	ans[i]
0	[0, 2]	[1, 2, 4]	No	-	[1, 2, 4]	-1
1	[0, 0]	[1]	Yes	Already equal	[1]	0
2	[1, 2]	[2, 4]	Yes	nums[1] + k = 2 + 2 = 4 = nums[2]	[4, 4]	1
Thus, ans = [-1, 0, 1].
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n == nums.length <= 4 × 10^4
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9​​
- 1 <= k <= 10^9
- 1 <= queries.length <= 4 × 10^4
- ​​​​​​​queries[i] = [li, ri]
- 0 <= li <= ri <= n - 1

<summary>Hint 1</summary>

To make all elements in a subarray equal, they must all share the same remainder when divided by k.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

The problem is equivalent to making nums[i] / k equal for all elements in the subarray. The minimum operations to achieve this is to make them all equal to the median of these nums[i] / k values.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

To handle many queries efficiently, pre-process the array. Group elements by their remainder mod k. For each group, we need a data structure to find the median and sum of absolute differences for any given range.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>

A Persistent Segment Tree can answer range median and range sum queries in logarithmic time, making it suitable for this problem.
