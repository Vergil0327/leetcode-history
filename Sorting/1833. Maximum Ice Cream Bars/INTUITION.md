# Sort + Greedy

## Intuition

sort in increasing order and take as much as we can take from lowest cost to largest cost

## Complexity

- time complexity
$$O(nlogn)$$

- space complexity
$$O(n)$$

# Bucket Sort

## Intuition

Since `cost` is in a reasonable scale ($1e5$), we can sort cost-count pair in bucket.

and take from smallest to largest as much as we can take

- time complexity
$$O(n)$$

- space complexity
$$O(n)$$
