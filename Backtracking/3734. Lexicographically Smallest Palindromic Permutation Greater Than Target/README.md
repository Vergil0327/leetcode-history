[3734. Lexicographically Smallest Palindromic Permutation Greater Than Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-smallest-palindromic-permutation-greater-than-target/)

`Hard`

Hint
You are given two strings s and target, each of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that is both a palindromic permutation of s and strictly greater than target. If no such permutation exists, return an empty string.

```
Example 1:
Input: s = "baba", target = "abba"
Output: "baab"
Explanation:

The palindromic permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "abba" and "baab".
The lexicographically smallest permutation that is strictly greater than target is "baab".

Example 2:
Input: s = "baba", target = "bbaa"
Output: ""
Explanation:

The palindromic permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "abba" and "baab".
None of them is lexicographically strictly greater than target. Therefore, the answer is "".

Example 3:
Input: s = "abc", target = "abb"
Output: ""
Explanation:

s has no palindromic permutations. Therefore, the answer is "".

Example 4:
Input: s = "aac", target = "abb"
Output: "aca"
Explanation:

The only palindromic permutation of s is "aca".
"aca" is strictly greater than target. Therefore, the answer is "aca".
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n == s.length == target.length <= 300
- s and target consist of only lowercase English letters.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

A palindromic permutation exists only if at most one character has an odd count (for odd-length strings) or all counts are even (for even-length strings).

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Focus on constructing the first half of the palindrome. The second half is determined by mirroring.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

To be lexicographically greater than target, the first half must be greater than or equal to target's first half, with careful handling of the middle character for odd-length strings.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>

Use a backtracking approach or greedy selection for each position in the first half, trying the smallest available character that can still produce a valid palindrome.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>

After building the first half, mirror it (and add the middle character if needed) to form the full palindrome and verify it is strictly greater than target.
