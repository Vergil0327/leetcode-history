[3720. Lexicographically Smallest Permutation Greater Than Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-smallest-permutation-greater-than-target/)

`Medium`

You are given two strings s and target, both having length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Return the lexicographically smallest permutation of s that is strictly greater than target. If no permutation of s is lexicographically strictly greater than target, return an empty string.

A string a is lexicographically strictly greater than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.

```
Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", target = "bba"
Output: "bca"
Explanation:

The permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", and "cba".
The lexicographically smallest permutation that is strictly greater than target is "bca".

Example 2:
Input: s = "leet", target = "code"
Output: "eelt"
Explanation:
The permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "eelt", "eetl", "elet", "elte", "etel", "etle", "leet", "lete", "ltee", "teel", "tele", and "tlee".
The lexicographically smallest permutation that is strictly greater than target is "eelt".

Example 3:
Input: s = "baba", target = "bbaa"
Output: ""
Explanation:
The permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "aabb", "abab", "abba", "baab", "baba", and "bbaa".
None of them is lexicographically strictly greater than target. Therefore, the answer is "".
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length == target.length <= 300
- s and target consist of only lowercase English letters.

<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Maintain frequency counts of s.

<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Walk left-to-right; if equal to target[i] is possible, take it and continue.

<summary>Hint 3</summary>

If not, try the smallest letter strictly greater than target[i].

If neither, backtrack left to the most recent index where you matched target and try to bump there.
