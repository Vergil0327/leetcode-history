`Hard`

A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either a or b.

Given the three integers n, a, and b, return the nth magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

```
Example 1:
Input: n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 6
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 10^9
- 2 <= a, b <= 4 * 10^4
