[3333. Find the Original Typed String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-typed-string-ii/)

`Hard`

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen. You are also given a positive integer k.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type, if she was trying to type a string of size at least k.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

```
Example 1:
Input: word = "aabbccdd", k = 7
Output: 5
Explanation:
The possible strings are: "aabbccdd", "aabbccd", "aabbcdd", "aabccdd", and "abbccdd".

Example 2:
Input: word = "aabbccdd", k = 8
Output: 1
Explanation:
The only possible string is "aabbccdd".

Example 3:
Input: word = "aaabbb", k = 3
Output: 8
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= word.length <= 5 * 10^5
- word consists only of lowercase English letters.
- 1 <= k <= 2000

Instead of solving for at least k, can we solve for at most k - 1 length?
