[3743. Maximize Cyclic Partition Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-cyclic-partition-score/)

`Hard`

You are given a cyclic array nums and an integer k.
Partition nums into at most k subarrays. As nums is cyclic, these subarrays may wrap around from the end of the array back to the beginning.
The range of a subarray is the difference between its maximum and minimum values. The score of a partition is the sum of subarray ranges.
Return the maximum possible score among all cyclic partitions.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3], k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
Partition nums into [2, 3] and [3, 1] (wrapped around).
The range of [2, 3] is max(2, 3) - min(2, 3) = 3 - 2 = 1.
The range of [3, 1] is max(3, 1) - min(3, 1) = 3 - 1 = 2.
The score is 1 + 2 = 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
Partition nums into [1, 2, 3, 3].
The range of [1, 2, 3, 3] is max(1, 2, 3, 3) - min(1, 2, 3, 3) = 3 - 1 = 2.
The score is 2.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3], k = 4
Output: 3
Explanation:
Identical to Example 1, we partition nums into [2, 3] and [3, 1]. Note that nums may be partitioned into fewer than k subarrays.

<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Use dynamic programming on the number of extreme picks: allow up to 2 * k picks (each partition can supply a + and a -), so the problem becomes choosing which elements are + or -.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Model a partition by its max (+nums[i]) and min (-nums[i]) contributions; selecting an element as a max adds +nums[i], and selecting it as a min adds -nums[i].

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Use a DP state (picks, balance) where picks is the total number of + and - chosen so far (<= 2 * k), and balance represents the difference between the counts of + and - currently; at each i, you conceptually take +, take -, or skip.

<summary>Hint 4</summary>

Handle cyclicity by limiting balance to the range [0, 2]. You can show that such a balance is always achievable.
