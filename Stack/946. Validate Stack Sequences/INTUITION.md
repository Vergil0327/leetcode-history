# Intuition

- use stack to simulate process
- use two pointers to keep tracks of element we pushed and popped

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(m+n)$$ where m is size of $$pushed$$ and n is size of $$popped$$

- Space complexity:
$$O(n)$$ where m is size of $$pushed$$ and n is size of $$popped$$
