[3816. Lexicographically Smallest String After Deleting Duplicate Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-smallest-string-after-deleting-duplicate-characters/)

`Hard`

You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero times):

Choose any letter that appears at least twice in the current string s and delete any one occurrence.
Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string that can be formed this way.


Example 1:
Input: s = "aaccb"
Output: "aacb"
Explanation:

We can form the strings "acb", "aacb", "accb", and "aaccb". "aacb" is the lexicographically smallest one.

For example, we can obtain "aacb" by choosing 'c' and deleting its first occurrence.

Example 2:
Input: s = "z"
Output: "z"
Explanation:

We cannot perform any operations. The only string we can form is "z".


Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= $10^5$
- s contains lowercase English letters only.
