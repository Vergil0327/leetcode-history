[3821. Find Nth Smallest Integer With K One Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-nth-smallest-integer-with-k-one-bits/)

Hard

You are given two positive integers n and k.

Return an integer denoting the nth smallest positive integer that has exactly k ones in its binary representation. It is guaranteed that the answer is strictly less than $2^{50}$.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: 9
Explanation:

The 4 smallest positive integers that have exactly k = 2 ones in their binary representations are:

3 = 112
5 = 1012
6 = 1102
9 = 10012

Example 2:
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:

The 3 smallest positive integers that have exactly k = 1 one in their binary representations are:

1 = 12
2 = 102
4 = 1002
 

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 2^50
- 1 <= k <= 50
- The answer is strictly less than 2^50.

Hint 1
Since the answer is strictly less than 2^50, we can iterate over the number of bits (the length) of the result.
Hint 2
Precompute binomial coefficients C(n, k) to count how many numbers with exactly k set bits exist for a given length.
Hint 3
Determine the position of the most significant bit first, then greedily determine the remaining bits from MSB to LSB based on the remaining count n.
