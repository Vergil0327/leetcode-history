# Intuition

first of all, O(n^2) is acceptable because `1 <= n == nums.length <= 1500`.
1500 * 1500 ~ 10^6 => leetcode's constraint is roughly this level.

### Problem Overview

We're tasked with finding the maximum score of a contiguous subarray after performing at most k doubling operations. The score is defined as length × GCD(subarray), where each element can be doubled at most once. This creates an interesting optimization problem that combines number theory with dynamic programming concepts.

### Key Insights

**The Power of Two Factor**

The crucial insight is that doubling an element only adds a factor of 2. If we have a subarray with GCD `g`, and we can double all elements, the new GCD becomes `2g`. However, the constraint is that we can only double elements if we have enough operations (k) available.

The solution handles this by:

1. Preprocessing: Count the number of factors of 2 in each element
2. Strategic Selection: For each subarray, determine if we can afford to double all elements to maximize the GCD

Why Count Factors of 2?
```python
count2 = []
for num in nums:
    cnt = 0
    while num % 2 == 0:
        num //= 2
        cnt += 1
    count2.append(cnt)
```
This preprocessing step is because:

- It identifies how "even" each number is
- Numbers with fewer factors of 2 become the bottleneck for GCD improvement
- We only need to consider doubling if it helps the entire subarray

the core idea is:

```py
res = 0
for i in range(n):
    GCD = 0
    
    for j in range(i, n):
        GCD = nums[j] if i == j else gcd(GCD, nums[j])
        length = j-i+1

        res = max(res, length * GCD * pow(2, ???))
return res
```

**what's the bottleneck for doubling GCD?**

we can double GCD only if our `k` operations is enough for minimum number of `factor-2s` in subarray.

since each element can only be doubled at most once, we only need to track how many minimum `factor-2s` it is.

if our `k` operations is enough for all of minimum `factor-2s` be doubled, our GCD can be doubled too!

### The Bottleneck Strategy

```python
if count2[j] < min_count2:
    min_count2 = count2[j]
    cnt = 1
elif count2[j] == min_count2:
    cnt += 1
```
This section implements a optimization strategy:

- `min_count2`: The minimum number of factor-2s among all elements in the current subarray
- `cnt`: How many elements have this minimum count

The logic is: If we want to double the GCD of the entire subarray, we need to double ALL elements. The elements with the fewest factors of 2 determine how many operations we need.

after all of these, the final scoring uses a mathematical trick:

- `pow(2, int(cnt <= k))` evaluates to:
  - 2^1 = 2 if cnt <= k (we can afford to double)
  - 2^0 = 1 if cnt > k (we cannot afford to double)

Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n² × log(max(nums))) - for each of the n² subarrays, we compute GCD
- Space Complexity: O(n) - for storing the factor-2 counts

### Conclusion

This solution demonstrates how mathematical insights can lead to proper algorithms. By recognizing that:

- Doubling only affects factors of 2
- GCD improvement requires doubling ALL elements
- The bottleneck element determines the operation cost
