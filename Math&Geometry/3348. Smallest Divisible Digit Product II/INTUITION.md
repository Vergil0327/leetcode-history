## Problem Breakdown and Intuition

1. Zero-Free Requirement: We need to find a number that does not contain any zeroes.

2. Product Divisibility: The product of the digits of the resulting number must be divisible by `t`. This suggests we may need to factor `t` into primes and ensure that the resulting number's digit product covers these prime factors.

3. Minimal Value: We need the smallest possible number that meets the above requirements. To achieve this, we try modifying the digits of the initial number string `num` as little as possible.

4. Factorization Approach: The core idea is to factorize `t` and ensure the digits in our resulting number match these factors to make the digit product divisible by `t`.

## Explanation of Each Step in `smallestNumber`

1. Prime Factorization Check:
   - Factorize `t` by dividing it by primes 2,3,5, and 7
2,3,5,and 7. If `t` has other prime factors, it’s impossible to create a product divisible by `t` with single-digit numbers, so return "-1".

2. Compute Required Divisibility Array `prefix`:
   - For each digit in `num`, compute the required divisibility for the prefix `num[:i]`. This array `prefix` helps track how much the product must still be divisible by as we modify digits in `num`.

3. Early Exit if Original Number is Valid:
   - If `prefix[-1]` equals 1, `num` itself is already divisible by `t`, so return `num`.

4. Modify Digits to Create Smallest Valid Number:
   - Identify the first '0' in `num` (if any) and use it as the boundary for modification.
   - For each digit in `num` (starting from the rightmost), attempt to replace it with the smallest possible digit that yields a product divisible by `t`. The fill function is used to construct the smallest possible suffix for the required divisibility.

5. Return Constructed Number or Construct New Minimum:
   - If no valid modification was found, use `fill` to generate a new number with one additional digit that meets the product requirement.
