[3785. Minimum Swaps to Avoid Forbidden Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-avoid-forbidden-values/)

`Hard`

You are given two integer arrays, nums and forbidden, each of length n.

You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Choose two distinct indices i and j, and swap nums[i] with nums[j].

Return the minimum number of swaps required such that, for every index i, the value of nums[i] is not equal to forbidden[i]. If no amount of swaps can ensure that every index avoids its forbidden value, return -1.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], forbidden = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:

One optimal set of swaps:

Select indices i = 0 and j = 1 in nums and swap them, resulting in nums = [2, 1, 3].
After this swap, for every index i, nums[i] is not equal to forbidden[i].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,6,6,5], forbidden = [4,6,5,5]
Output: 2
Explanation:

One optimal set of swaps:
Select indices i = 0 and j = 2 in nums and swap them, resulting in nums = [6, 6, 4, 5].
Select indices i = 1 and j = 3 in nums and swap them, resulting in nums = [6, 5, 4, 6].
After these swaps, for every index i, nums[i] is not equal to forbidden[i].

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7], forbidden = [8,7]
Output: -1
Explanation:

It is not possible to make nums[i] different from forbidden[i] for all indices.

Example 4:
Input: nums = [1,2], forbidden = [2,1]
Output: 0
Explanation:

No swaps are required because nums[i] is already different from forbidden[i] for all indices, so the answer is 0.

 

Constraints:

- 1 <= n == nums.length == forbidden.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i], forbidden[i] <= 10^9

<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Count combined frequencies of values in nums and forbidden into a map freq.

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

If any freq[val] >= n + 1 return -1 (impossible).

Collect bad positions (nums[i] == forbidden[i]) into a map badPairs[val] counts.

<details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>

Let badPairsSum be the sum of all bad counts and maxBadPairs the maximum bad count for any single value.
