[3480. Maximize Subarrays After Removing One Conflicting Pair](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-subarrays-after-removing-one-conflicting-pair/)

`Hard`

You are given an integer n which represents an array nums containing the numbers from 1 to n in order. Additionally, you are given a 2D array conflictingPairs, where conflictingPairs[i] = [a, b] indicates that a and b form a conflicting pair.

Remove exactly one element from conflictingPairs. Afterward, count the number of non-empty subarrays of nums which do not contain both a and b for any remaining conflicting pair [a, b].

Return the maximum number of subarrays possible after removing exactly one conflicting pair.

```
Example 1:
Input: n = 4, conflictingPairs = [[2,3],[1,4]]
Output: 9
Explanation:
Remove [2, 3] from conflictingPairs. Now, conflictingPairs = [[1, 4]].
There are 9 subarrays in nums where [1, 4] do not appear together. They are [1], [2], [3], [4], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 2, 3] and [2, 3, 4].
The maximum number of subarrays we can achieve after removing one element from conflictingPairs is 9.

Example 2:
Input: n = 5, conflictingPairs = [[1,2],[2,5],[3,5]]
Output: 12
Explanation:
Remove [1, 2] from conflictingPairs. Now, conflictingPairs = [[2, 5], [3, 5]].
There are 12 subarrays in nums where [2, 5] and [3, 5] do not appear together.
The maximum number of subarrays we can achieve after removing one element from conflictingPairs is 12.
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= conflictingPairs.length <= 2 * n
- conflictingPairs[i].length == 2
- 1 <= conflictingPairs[i][j] <= n
- conflictingPairs[i][0] != conflictingPairs[i][1]

<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Let f[i] (where i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n) be the end index of the longest valid subarray (without any conflicting pair) starting at index i.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

The answer is: sigma(f[i] - i + 1) for i in [1..n], which simplifies to: sigma(f[i]) - n * (n + 1) / 2 + n.

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Focus on maintaining f[i].

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>

If we have a conflicting pair (x, y) with x < y: 1. Sort the conflicting pairs by y values in non-increasing order. 2. Update each prefix of the f array accordingly.

<summary>Hint 5</summary>

Use a segment tree or another suitable data structure to maintain the range update and sum query efficiently.
