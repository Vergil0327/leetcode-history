[236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

`Medium`

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

```
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
- -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
- All Node.val are unique.
- p != q
- p and q will exist in the tree.

Approach 2: Iterative using parent pointers

Intuition

If we have parent pointers for each node we can traverse back from p and q to get their ancestors. The first common node we get during this traversal would be the LCA node. We can save the parent pointers in a dictionary as we traverse the tree.

Algorithm

1. Start from the root node and traverse the tree.
2. Until we find p and q both, keep storing the parent pointers in a dictionary.
3. Once we have found both p and q, we get all the ancestors for p using the parent dictionary and add to a set called ancestors.
4. Similarly, we traverse through ancestors for node q. If the ancestor is present in the ancestors set for p, this means this is the first ancestor common between p and q (while traversing upwards) and hence this is the LCA node.

```python
class Solution:

    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """

        # Stack for tree traversal
        stack = [root]

        # Dictionary for parent pointers
        parent = {root: None}

        # Iterate until we find both the nodes p and q
        while p not in parent or q not in parent:

            node = stack.pop()

            # While traversing the tree, keep saving the parent pointers.
            if node.left:
                parent[node.left] = node
                stack.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                parent[node.right] = node
                stack.append(node.right)

        # Ancestors set() for node p.
        ancestors = set()

        # Process all ancestors for node p using parent pointers.
        while p:
            ancestors.add(p)
            p = parent[p]

        # The first ancestor of q which appears in
        # p's ancestor set() is their lowest common ancestor.
        while q not in ancestors:
            q = parent[q]
        return q
```
