[3715. Sum of Perfect Square Ancestors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-perfect-square-ancestors/)

`Hard`

You are given an integer n and an undirected tree rooted at node 0 with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. This is represented by a 2D array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates an undirected edge between nodes ui and vi.

You are also given an integer array nums, where nums[i] is the positive integer assigned to node i.

Define a value ti as the number of ancestors of node i such that the product nums[i] * nums[ancestor] is a perfect square.

Return the sum of all ti values for all nodes i in range [1, n - 1].

Note:

In a rooted tree, the ancestors of node i are all nodes on the path from node i to the root node 0, excluding i itself.
 
```
Example 1:
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], nums = [2,8,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:

i	Ancestors	nums[i] * nums[ancestor]	Square Check	ti
1	[0]	nums[1] * nums[0] = 8 * 2 = 16	16 is a perfect square	1
2	[1, 0]	nums[2] * nums[1] = 2 * 8 = 16
nums[2] * nums[0] = 2 * 2 = 4	Both 4 and 16 are perfect squares	2
Thus, the total number of valid ancestor pairs across all non-root nodes is 1 + 2 = 3.

Example 2:
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], nums = [1,2,4]
Output: 1
Explanation:

i	Ancestors	nums[i] * nums[ancestor]	Square Check	ti
1	[0]	nums[1] * nums[0] = 2 * 1 = 2	2 is not a perfect square	0
2	[0]	nums[2] * nums[0] = 4 * 1 = 4	4 is a perfect square	1
Thus, the total number of valid ancestor pairs across all non-root nodes is 1.

Example 3:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3]], nums = [1,2,9,4]
Output: 2
Explanation:

i	Ancestors	nums[i] * nums[ancestor]	Square Check	ti
1	[0]	nums[1] * nums[0] = 2 * 1 = 2	2 is not a perfect square	0
2	[0]	nums[2] * nums[0] = 9 * 1 = 9	9 is a perfect square	1
3	[1, 0]	nums[3] * nums[1] = 4 * 2 = 8
nums[3] * nums[0] = 4 * 1 = 4	Only 4 is a perfect square	1
Thus, the total number of valid ancestor pairs across all non-root nodes is 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- edges.length == n - 1
- edges[i] = [ui, vi]
- 0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1
- nums.length == n
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
- The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Notice that the product nums[i] * nums[ancestor] is a perfect square if and only if both numbers have the same "square-free kernel" (i.e., after removing all even powers of primes, the remaining product is identical).

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Precompute the square-free representation of every node's value using prime factorization up to max(nums[i]).

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Perform a DFS from the root. While traversing down the tree, maintain a frequency map of the square-free values of the ancestors.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>

For each node, the number of valid ancestors equals the count of ancestors with the same square-free value.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>

Carefully backtrack the frequency map after finishing a subtree to maintain correctness.
