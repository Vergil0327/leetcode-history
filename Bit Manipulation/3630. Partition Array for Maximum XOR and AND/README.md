[3630. Partition Array for Maximum XOR and AND](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-for-maximum-xor-and-and/description/)

`Hard`

You are given an integer array nums.

Partition the array into three (possibly empty) subsequences A, B, and C such that every element of nums belongs to exactly one subsequence.

Your goal is to maximize the value of: XOR(A) + AND(B) + XOR(C)

where:

XOR(arr) denotes the bitwise XOR of all elements in arr. If arr is empty, its value is defined as 0.
AND(arr) denotes the bitwise AND of all elements in arr. If arr is empty, its value is defined as 0.
Return the maximum value achievable.

Note: If multiple partitions result in the same maximum sum, you can consider any one of them.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3]
Output: 5
Explanation:

One optimal partition is:

A = [3], XOR(A) = 3
B = [2], AND(B) = 2
C = [], XOR(C) = 0
The maximum value of: XOR(A) + AND(B) + XOR(C) = 3 + 2 + 0 = 5. Thus, the answer is 5.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,2]
Output: 6
Explanation:
One optimal partition is:

A = [1], XOR(A) = 1
B = [2], AND(B) = 2
C = [3], XOR(C) = 3
The maximum value of: XOR(A) + AND(B) + XOR(C) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Thus, the answer is 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,3,6,7]
Output: 15
Explanation:

One optimal partition is:

A = [7], XOR(A) = 7
B = [2,3], AND(B) = 2
C = [6], XOR(C) = 6
The maximum value of: XOR(A) + AND(B) + XOR(C) = 7 + 2 + 6 = 15. Thus, the answer is 15.

We want to choose a value x (a subset‚ÄêXOR of the "remaining" elements) to maximize x + (s XOR x).

Observe that x + (s XOR x) = s + 2 * (x AND ~s).

To do this efficiently, build a linear XOR basis over the values nums[j] & ~s for each index j not in B.
