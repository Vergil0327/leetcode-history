[3806. Maximum Bitwise AND After Increment Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-bitwise-and-after-increment-operations/)

`Hard`

You are given an integer array nums and two integers k and m.

You may perform at most k operations. In one operation, you may choose any index i and increase nums[i] by 1.

Return an integer denoting the maximum possible bitwise AND of any subset of size m after performing up to k operations optimally.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,2], k = 8, m = 2
Output: 6
Explanation:

We need a subset of size m = 2. Choose indices [0, 2].
Increase nums[0] = 3 to 6 using 3 operations, and increase nums[2] = 2 to 6 using 4 operations.
The total number of operations used is 7, which is not greater than k = 8.
The two chosen values become [6, 6], and their bitwise AND is 6, which is the maximum possible.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,8,4], k = 7, m = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:

We need a subset of size m = 3. Choose indices [0, 1, 3].
Increase nums[0] = 1 to 4 using 3 operations, increase nums[1] = 2 to 4 using 2 operations, and keep nums[3] = 4.
The total number of operations used is 5, which is not greater than k = 7.
The three chosen values become [4, 4, 4], and their bitwise AND is 4, which is the maximum possible.​​​​​​​

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1], k = 3, m = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:

We need a subset of size m = 2. Choose indices [0, 1].
Increase both values from 1 to 2 using 1 operation each.
The total number of operations used is 2, which is not greater than k = 3.
The two chosen values become [2, 2], and their bitwise AND is 2, which is the maximum possible.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n == nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- 1 <= k <= 10^9
- 1 <= m <= n

<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Use a greedy bitwise approach.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Iterate bits from highest to lowest and try setting the current bit in a candidate res.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

To test a candidate, for each num compute the minimal increments needed so that (num | candidate) == candidate; take the smallest m costs and check if their sum <= k.

<summary>Hint 4</summary>

If feasible, keep the bit in res and continue with accumulated bits.
