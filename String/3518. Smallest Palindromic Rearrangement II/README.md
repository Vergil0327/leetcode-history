[3518. Smallest Palindromic Rearrangement II](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-palindromic-rearrangement-ii/)

`Hard`

You are given a palindromic string s and an integer k.

Return the k-th lexicographically smallest palindromic permutation of s. If there are fewer than k distinct palindromic permutations, return an empty string.

Note: Different rearrangements that yield the same palindromic string are considered identical and are counted once.

```
Example 1:
Input: s = "abba", k = 2
Output: "baab"
Explanation:

The two distinct palindromic rearrangements of "abba" are "abba" and "baab".
Lexicographically, "abba" comes before "baab". Since k = 2, the output is "baab".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aa", k = 2
Output: ""
Explanation:

There is only one palindromic rearrangement: "aa".
The output is an empty string since k = 2 exceeds the number of possible rearrangements.

Example 3:
Input: s = "bacab", k = 1
Output: "abcba"
Explanation:

The two distinct palindromic rearrangements of "bacab" are "abcba" and "bacab".
Lexicographically, "abcba" comes before "bacab". Since k = 1, the output is "abcba".
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists of lowercase English letters.
- s is guaranteed to be palindromic.
- 1 <= k <= 10^6

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Only build floor(n / 2) characters (the rest are determined by symmetry).

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Count character frequencies and use half the counts for construction.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Incrementally choose each character (from smallest to largest) and calculate how many valid arrangements result if that character is chosen at the current index.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>

If the count is at least k, fix that character; otherwise, subtract the count from k and try the next candidate.

<summary>Hint 5</summary>

Use combinatorics to compute the number of permutations at each step.
