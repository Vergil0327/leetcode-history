[3922. Minimum Flips to Make Binary String Coherent](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-flips-to-make-binary-string-coherent/)

`Medium`

You are given a binary string s.

A string is considered coherent if it does not contain "011" or "110" as subsequences.

In one operation, you can flip any character in s ('0' to '1' or '1' to '0').

Return an integer denoting the minimum number of modifications required to make s coherent.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.


Example 1:
Input: s = "1010"
Output: 1
Explanation:
Flip s[0] to get "0010", which contains no "011" or "110" subsequences.

Example 2:
Input: s = "0110"
Output: 1
Explanation:
Flip s[1] to get "0010", removing all forbidden subsequences "011" and "110".

Example 3:
Input: s = "1000"
Output: 0
Explanation:
The string already has no "011" or "110" subsequences, so no flips are needed.


Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= $10^5$
- s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
