[3646. Next Special Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-special-palindrome-number/)

`Hard`

You are given an integer n.

A number is called special if:

It is a palindrome.
Every digit k in the number appears exactly k times.
Return the smallest special number strictly greater than n.

```
Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 22
Explanation:

22 is the smallest special number greater than 2, as it is a palindrome and the digit 2 appears exactly 2 times.

Example 2:
Input: n = 33
Output: 212
Explanation:

212 is the smallest special number greater than 33, as it is a palindrome and the digits 1 and 2 appear exactly 1 and 2 times respectively.
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 10^15
