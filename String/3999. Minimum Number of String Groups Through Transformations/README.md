[3999. Minimum Number of String Groups Through Transformations](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-string-groups-through-transformations/)

`Hard`

You are given an array of strings words.

Define a transformation on a string s as follows:

Let E be the subsequence of characters at even indices of s.
Let O be the subsequence of characters at odd indices of s.
Independently cyclically shift E and O by any number of positions to the right, possibly zero.
Reconstruct the string by placing the shifted E characters back into even indices and the shifted O characters back into odd indices.
Two strings are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by a single transformation.

Partition words into the minimum number of groups such that:

Every string belongs to exactly one group.
Every pair of strings in the same group are equivalent.
Return an integer denoting the minimum number of groups.


Example 1:
Input: words = ["ntgwz","zwntg"]
Output: 1
Explanation:
For "ntgwz", the even-index subsequence is "ngz" and the odd-index subsequence is "tw".
Shift "ngz" right by 1 position to obtain "zng", and shift "tw" right by 1 position to obtain "wt".
After reconstructing the string, we obtain "zwntg".
Therefore, both strings are equivalent and belong to the same group.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["abc","cab","bac","acb","bca","cba"]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The strings can be partitioned into the following groups:

["abc","cba"]
["cab","bac"]
["acb","bca"]

Example 3:
Input: words = ["leet","abb","bab","deed","edde","code","bba"]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The strings can be partitioned into the following groups:

["abb","bba"]
["deed","edde"]
["leet"]
["bab"]
["code"]
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​All pairs of strings in each group are equivalent.

Constraints:

- 1 <= words.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 5 * 10^5
- The sum of words[i].length does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
- words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.

<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Separate each word into the characters at even indices and the characters at odd indices.

<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Two words are equivalent if their even-index subsequences are cyclic shifts of each other and their odd-index subsequences are cyclic shifts of each other.

<summary>Hint 3</summary>
For each subsequence, compute a canonical representative of its cyclic rotations, such as its lexicographically smallest cyclic rotation. This can be found efficiently using Booth's algorithm, Duval's algorithm, or even a suffix-array-based approach on the doubled string etc.

<summary>Hint 4</summary>
Use the pair of canonical representatives as the signature of the word. The answer is the number of distinct signatures.
