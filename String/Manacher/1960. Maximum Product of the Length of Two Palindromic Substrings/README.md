[1960. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-the-length-of-two-palindromic-substrings/)

`Hard`

You are given a 0-indexed string s and are tasked with finding two non-intersecting palindromic substrings of odd length such that the product of their lengths is maximized.

More formally, you want to choose four integers i, j, k, l such that 0 <= i <= j < k <= l < s.length and both the substrings s[i...j] and s[k...l] are palindromes and have odd lengths. s[i...j] denotes a substring from index i to index j inclusive.

Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two non-intersecting palindromic substrings.

A palindrome is a string that is the same forward and backward. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

```
Example 1:
Input: s = "ababbb"
Output: 9
Explanation: Substrings "aba" and "bbb" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 * 3 = 9.

Example 2:
Input: s = "zaaaxbbby"
Output: 9
Explanation: Substrings "aaa" and "bbb" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 * 3 = 9.
``` 

Constraints:

- 2 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s consists of lowercase English letters.

You can use Manacher's algorithm to get the maximum palindromic substring centered at each index

<summary>Hint 2</summary>

After using Manacher's for each center use a line sweep from the center to the left and from the center to the right to find for each index the farthest center to it with distance â‰¤ palin[center]

After that, find the maximum palindrome size for each prefix in the string and for each suffix and the answer would be max(prefix[i] * suffix[i + 1])
